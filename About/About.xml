This mod will put some basic information into the inspect window for the current selected zone. 

Feature:
This mod will put some basic information into the inspect window for the current selected zone.

The mod analyzes the stored items in a zone and performs some magic. It adds a scrollable list of entries into the inspect window if a zone is selected. The default handling for other selections is not touched! The list contains an icon, the label and the total number of things in the zone. 

ToDo:
 - alphabetical sorting of entries
 - dynamic height of inspect window for larger lists
 - include currently excluded entries (things without icon will be placed at the end of the list)

 Version:
 1.0.17.2
