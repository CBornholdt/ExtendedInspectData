Current Version: 1.1.17.5

This mod will put some basic information into the inspect window for the current selected zone. 

For zones to store things:
The mod analyzes the stored items in a zone and performs some magic. It adds a scrollable list of entries into the inspect window if a zone is selected. The default handling for other selections is not touched! The list contains an icon, the label and the total number of things in the zone. 


For zones to grow plants:
Adds a graph to the inspect window showing the distribution of growth values of the plants in the zone.
The graph contains these information:
 - x axis = growth value in percent (a plant has growth value of 0-100%)
 - y axis = percentage of total planted plants in the zone that reached growth value x
 - The white vertical line marks the growth value that is needed to harvest a plant.

Below the graph you find the following information from left to right
 - Total of cells with no plant in it (this includes cells that are marked as growing zone, but have a lamp on it or so)
 - Total cells with plants in it (any growth value)
 - Total number of plants that cannot be harvested yet (left of white line)
 - Total number of plants that can be harvested (right of white line)
 - Total number of fully grown plants (growth value = 100%)
