This mod will put some basic information into the inspect window for the current selected zone. 

For zones to store things:
The mod analyzes the stored items in a zone and performs some magic. It adds a scrollable list of entries into the inspect window if a zone is selected. The default handling for other selections is not touched! The list contains an icon, the label and the total number of things in the zone. 


 Version:
